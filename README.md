A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational content between students and teachers. We decided to name our learning management system “PATHSHALA” since it resembles a school (Pathshala means school in Hindi), the only difference is that it is online. It is an online school. In this application, we focus on developing a system that can cater to the needs of teachers by providing them options of making announcements, creating assignments and quizzes, or uploading lectures for students to refer to. On the other hand, students will be able to use this system for submitting their assignments, attempting quizzes, viewing or downloading lectures as well as analyzing their performance. This software helps to make the collaboration of teachers and students interactive, easier, and accessible outside schools and classrooms.

In this project, we have implemented a learning management system with the features mentioned above. We have integrated subjects taught until semester 5 like Python Programming, Database Management System and Advanced Database Management System, Information and Network Security, Web Programming, and Data Structures. It has helped us to get a comprehensive practical experience and gave us a platform to put the skills we have learned into experience into practice.
